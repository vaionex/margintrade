	<h1>About MarginTrade</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 1.15rem;">MarginTrade.com is your trusted resource for independent margin trading exchange reviews, comparisons, and educational content. Our mission is to help traders make informed decisions about leveraged trading platforms.</p>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>We believe that informed traders make better traders. The margin trading landscape can be complex and overwhelming, with dozens of platforms offering different features, fee structures, and leverage options. Our goal is to simplify this landscape through:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Independent reviews</strong> — We test every platform ourselves before recommending it</li>
		<li><strong>Data-driven rankings</strong> — Our scores are based on objective criteria, not paid placements</li>
		<li><strong>Educational content</strong> — From beginner basics to advanced strategies</li>
		<li><strong>Risk education</strong> — We always put risk awareness first</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What We Cover</h2>
	<p>MarginTrade covers margin trading across all major markets:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cryptocurrency exchanges</strong> — Binance, Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and more</li>
		<li><strong>Traditional brokers</strong> — Interactive Brokers, IG Markets, eToro, Plus500</li>
		<li><strong>CFD platforms</strong> — For stocks, forex, indices, and commodities</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How We Make Money</h2>
	<p>Transparency is important to us. MarginTrade earns revenue through affiliate/referral links. When you sign up for an exchange through our links, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. This helps us keep the site running and producing free educational content.</p>
	<p><strong>Important:</strong> Our affiliate relationships never influence our rankings or reviews. We recommend platforms based on merit, and we're honest about both strengths and weaknesses.</p>

	<h2>Our Review Process</h2>
	<p>Every exchange review on MarginTrade follows a rigorous process:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We create an account and verify it ourselves</li>
		<li>We test the platform with real trades</li>
		<li>We evaluate fees, features, security, and user experience</li>
		<li>We research the exchange's regulatory status and security history</li>
		<li>We compare with competitors on objective metrics</li>
		<li>We update reviews regularly to reflect changes</li>
	</ol>
