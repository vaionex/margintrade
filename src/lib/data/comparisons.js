			{ q: 'Is dYdX safer than Binance?', a: 'It depends on the risk type. dYdX eliminates exchange counterparty risk (no one can freeze or steal your funds like FTX). However, dYdX has smart contract risk and lower liquidity. Binance has stronger infrastructure but requires trusting a central entity with your funds.' },
			{ q: 'Can I use dYdX in the USA?', a: 'The dYdX protocol is globally accessible, but the official dYdX Trading front-end has restricted US users. Alternative front-ends may exist, but US users should consider regulatory implications.' },
			{ q: 'Why is dYdX leverage limited to 20x?', a: 'dYdX chose conservative leverage limits to prioritize protocol safety and reduce systemic risk. This reflects a different philosophy than CEXs that compete on maximum leverage.' }
